Hey, in the meadow the red guelder rose has bent down,
For some reason our glorious Ukraine is despairing.
But we will raise that red guelder rose up,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, cheer up!
 
Our volunteers are marshing into the bloody dance
To release our brothers-ukrainians from the hostile chains.
And we will rescue our brothers-ukrainians,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, we'll cheer up!

Do not bent, red guelder, for you have white flowers.
Don't be sad, our glorious Ukraine, for you've got a free kin.
And we will raise that red guelder rose up,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, cheer up!
 
Hey, there's a golden field of spring wheat,
Ukrainian riflemen started the dance with the enemies!
And we will reap the spring wheat,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, cheer up!
 
One day the wild wind will blow from the wide steppes,
glorifying the Sich Riflemen1 throughout Ukraine
And we will keep that glory of the Riflemen,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, we'll cheer up!
