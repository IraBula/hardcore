Hey, in the meadow the red guelder rose has bent down,
For some reason our glorious Ukraine is despairing.
But we will raise that red guelder rose up,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, cheer up!
 
Our volunteers are marshing into the bloody dance
To release our brothers-ukrainians from the hostile chains.
And we will rescue our brothers-ukrainians,
And we will cheer up our glorious Ukraine, hey, hey, we'll cheer up!
